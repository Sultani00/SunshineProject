The aim of this project is to learn Android Development. I would be doing this by taking a Udacity course.  The project specified for this course is to develop a Weather App. This app would have the ability to give accurate weather readings for a range of 7 days; it would have also images that show that show the forecasts of these days; also the app would have the ability to send notifications to the phone. The main goal of building this application is to learn Android design, patterns and best practices. After completing this application, I would infuse my newly learnt technologies to build an app of my own choice.
